 It’s A average product decent for day to day activity.. one the thing I would like to mention that exchange was Far Far alot Good On amazon it was like 2 to 3 minutes and delivery agent was very Good with me although I had 2 scratches on it but he neglected it as it was minor scratches and I exchanged poco m2 pro 6 64gb variant which was exchanged for rupees 10100. I bought it at 12499 1 and Half year ago and sold it at at very good price!! So plus point To amazonComing Back to device I would say it’s a ok device camera is average performance is Fine one plus is losing it’s originality oxygen os to color or..WARP CHARGER TO VOOC CHARGER!! yes it has been taken by oppo!! I wish the way we believed in one plus doesn’t change with it as A one plus Fan We don’t want To merge with Other brands please keep your Originality Maintained!! thanx amazon for such a hasselfree exchange alot better than FLIPKART

I got my delivery on 23 feb when I unboxed the phone the display was damaged. I requested for replacement of my new phone so technician was suppose to come for inspection but instead of a visit he just talked on call and asked me to install an application. He did not even saw the damage of my display screen.Lets hope amazon does it right replace my phone. Will update the rest later.But amazon pls consider my request and replace the item as soon as possibleEdit- The phone is perfect... They replaced it and now everything is perfect...Camera quality is as expected very perfectOverall performance bestYou can go for it

 Phone is is Fab!But sometime apps like Gaana, LinkedIn, etc are crashing, I think need to fix some bugs from OnePlus end.However, camera is good, finishing quality is good, sound effect could be better(not that load as compared to iPhone or other Mi phones)Touch is awesome, finger print sensor works too fast, excellent face detection unlockMost sexiest thing is charging, it charges way too quickly, 35-40min approx for full chageMany more extra features from Android Oxygen & One plus!!Phone is handy & a good buy in this range!

Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:Pros:- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed- Smooth performance and display- Comparatively compact and light weight- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)- Design and color is neatCons:- Speaker isn't great- Camera is okayish- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of nowDetailed:- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can't be uninstalled). Didn't find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo's ColorOS.- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven't noticed any heating afterwards.- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven't tested much low light or night photography.- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).Overall it's a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.

****Don't buy any phones from Amazon*** i really had a bad exp. DISLIKE:For 25k poor build quality. Same configuration in real me etc are coming less than 18k only. Just for 1+ brand don't buy for 25k.---> Audio is worst, single speaker but volume too low in calls for other end. I think phone mic issues.----> Back camera not good---> phone touch also I felt bit lack.Like:--------+Fast charging, within 30min 100% charge .Front cam bit okay.Battery backup is good.8 5g bands. Support, dual 4g standby.**** If OnePlus can promise if they can do something on back camera quality and Audio improvements with updates buy it with any offers. Otherwise go for real me gt master or 9pro or 9pro plus.  And moto mobiles also good. I was using moto for 6years for only good camera and sound i took this but those two only drawback for this phone rest all okay manageble. And no return policy only replacement.

 The Grey mirror finish is really cool and the phone is smooth in day to day usage. Charging speed is very fast but i couldn't test 0 to 100. As an estimate it'll take 30-45 mins for a full charge (Will update after testing). Cameras are all good and in par with RM9pro+(I do have it) especially the front cam. Overall it's a very good phone in this price range.

 Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos 😂 but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good

Bought this for my mother on the day of the launch. Lightweight and slim phone. Good look and specifications. The refresh rate is amazing given the cost. Satisfied with the product so far.

Best Operating system after iPhone so you and ur data is safe. Those who do all their banking transactions through mobile, understand it's need. Plus 3 years security update. That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good. See attached photo taken from 5 th floor.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Netflix. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 yes warranty. Seems like company is preety sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.Best of luck Chinese company... Till the time India doesn't develop its own effective mobile, keep earning. We will catch you soon!!

I got this mobile for ₹ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ₹3000 discount.Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.GB ram is enough for daily operation.My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ₹20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.

 At starting 2 days it was performing good and I have given 5 rating and now I reduced it 2. Continuous hang problem is going on in phone.i need restart it at least 2 times in a day. The processor is not taking load. Even when I am writing this review the back gesture is not working.

 I don't how the plethora of "" youtubers"" missed the obvious pointers. I am upgrading from redmi note 9 pro max, thus  never had very high expectations . This is review after 3 days of usage :-1) The UI is extremely clean and works like charm!! Make sure you do go display>screen refresh rate> 90 hz2) Please make sure you add your finger prints before adding tempered glass!! Very important3) Battery charges in 30-35 minutes.4) Pubg will give consistent 56-60 fps in smooth plus extreme5) Ok now, the most important point which I pray would go be improved in future updates!! The screen jitters like shit while scrolling webpages on Google Chrome. The only solution for this is to turn on high performance mode . The path for the same is Battery>additional setting > high performance modeHope this helps!!!Would let you guys know more after using this beast for a month!

Over heating while charging & too much heating when browsing through mobile network, even while using camera for capturing pics also phone getting too much heat, fast battery drain, face unlock not working properly, even sometimes phe getting hang while touching icons, phe heating in 1hr usage, while using Bluetooth headphones for calling the voice will be very low. So many Back drops are there. Not worthable. Its not up to the mark of one plus company. I am totally disappointed 😔

 Worst phone of my life
"

Writing the reviews after 3 days of UsageDesign: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything.

As a tech geek these are my experiences with this phone..1.Fingerprint scan is not smooth as compare to other low end phone also2. Due to omnivison camera, picture quality is not good in low light.. Okayish camera3. No inbuilt app for messages, dialer, recorder, notes.. All are google based apps4. MAJOR problem- It has google CALL RECORDER by default.. If you record during call ""it will prompt recording has started"" which can be heard to both caller and receiver.. I mean people use Call recorder for safety and secure purpose, but here it is opposite5. If you turn on WiFi hotspot for more than 10 15 minutes,it will start showing heating issue6. After software update, for twice my audio was not working, had to restart again7. Battery drains fast in ambient display mode..8. Did not find any difference in power saving mode aa compare to normal mode.. Battery drains in same speed in both mode..9. I mean its 2022, then why android 11?10..No stereo speakerFew pros :-Look wise its best.. Display is top notch.. Better than Oneplus CE.. 12bands 5g support.. comes with nfc..Few other issues are also there..

Bad product experience from the start.The SIM-MicroSD card slot is very confusing to operate. There’s also no instruction or label on whether SIM card slot is up, or the MicroSD card?This shows how much the product team focuses on first user experience. They should learn something from Apple.By the way, the MicroSD side is up and SIM card side is down.

The USB audio in oneplus phone is merged with OTG, so each time you connect your external dac( fiio k9 pro, earman tramp, chord mojo) you need to switch on the OTG.But the bug start from there once any of this device disconnects you will need to restart you DAC again and again till it is by luck detected by the OnePlus phone again.In OnePlus forum the OnePlus team seems to be proud of this ""feature"" but as a developer I do not understand why they merged the USB audio with OTG.Over all this is not the phone for any one who use USB audio regularly. Irony is oneplus stoped adding audio jacks to their phone and promoted the wireless accesories.In the end it's all about marketing and business.Never going to buy any OnePlus brand devices anymore.

I made the switch from my Samsung M51 to the Nord CE 2. I did a lot of research before settling on this phone. I read quite a lot of reviews as well. Here's my experience so far:1. I am not a gamer and do not use phones for gaming.2. I am not a photographer and am quite happy with simple photos. I don't care about contrast or saturation.3. I use my phone mainly for banking, messaging, browsing and calls.Switching from the Samsung M51, the Nord CE 2 feels a lot smoother. I can't tell much of a difference in the display between the two. The outdoor brightness for the phone is decent. There is no bloatware installed on the phone which is fantastic (Samsung needs to learn from this!). Sure, there is no Android 12 out of the box but I don't miss it since I've never used it and Android 11 is perfectly fine. The phone will receive the Android 12 update but it might take time (I'm in no hurry). The camera is fine for my needs. It comes with a headphone jack and a charger. Charging is fast -- I went from 50% to 100% in under 25 minutes. I also like that the phone is slightly smaller than the M51 and fits well in my hand and pocket. I've not experienced any overheating issues.Overall, for the price (I got a great deal since I exchanged my phone), it's a great phone. Some people are expecting too much from this phone but if your needs are simple like mine, this is an excellent device.

I didn't upload pics cause I forgot to take them. I am a one plus user since 2016. I bought one plus 3T when it was launched. That phone is still with me working fine. I am a true one plus fan. So my review on this phone is that it very basic.To be honest I am disappointed with the phone. I agree it's a low and budget phone but still had better expectations.Pros: great feel in hand looks premium, Great battery and charging is like awesome. Sound is loud and brightness is also good. Videos look awesome. Touch is great, processor is 👌🏻Cons: not a gaming phone you'll be disappointed with that. Camera isn't that good at all. Body is plastic, speaker location makes it not audible with texting. Video get stuck and security and update patch is still not given.If you want to buy a phone for good use and want to use it for a long time. This is okay. But this is no where near to high gaming or photo fan phone

This phone is not really stand in the line of oneplus series. The hardware quality is been hardly severely compromise. Phone hangs a lot from the very first day. While on call the sound quality is not so good. Phone is extremely slow. Picture quality taken by the cameras is quite pixelate despite of all the settings. Overall we have regretted buying this phone.

Here are some important points that I noticed about the smartphone :1. Best Operating system after iPhone so you and ur data is safe. Those who do all their banking transactions through mobile, understand it's need. Plus 3 years security update. That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix etc. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 years warranty. Seems like company is pretty sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.I am thankful to the seller for providing me the phone in best condition and I thank Amazon for free and fast delivery.

So many option are either missing or not user-friendly.like back button or app switching option are very hard to use.camera quality is good.little bit mobile started hanging in 2  days even have not loaded with apps.very good thing is battery charging,it's takes hardly 30 minutes to 100% charged.so 25k price is very costly.it is 15k quality mobile.overall feeling like Chinese quality mobile compare to others.

It's just a Android phone with OnePlus branding. It came with lots of bugs. Camera also average not like anyone can expect from a OnePlus phone.Indisplay fingerprint and face lock are not fast as other brand phones.Charging is fast, but if you use a little bit while charging the speed will reduce automatically to 50watts. Only charging while phone switched off will give you proper speed.I have attached one screenshot, see in that screenshot it is showing in notification that charging is complete but in the top battery indicator it is showing 82%. Like this many other bugs are there. Hope OnePlus will eliminate all such bugs in next update as it comes with a old Android version 11 and latest is Android 12. It's just one weeks of usage and there's a lot of issues don't know where to report.Thanks for reading. This is my honest review on this device.

Reached out to customer service but i will have to wait 2 more days before a technician visits and checks. Though i clearly showed that the phone is not starting and also the reset did not work and the phone is still not able to boot. Great.Edit: Replaced but delivery executive told this is the most returned product. So definitely there are issues. Lets see till when does this replacement works. First ever return in around 5-8 Phone from different company. One plus needs to step up or its same as getting any vivo/oppo/mi. Increasing couple of stars.Hail Apple! #makeappleinindia

1. Camera is outstanding. Macro,wide angle and normal. All are up to the mark.2. With 65W super vooc charger in 20 mins charge goes from 43 to 100.3. But battery life is low. I was just editing a normal video and charge went from 100 to 84 within an hour.4. Heating up issues not severe.5. Use a phone case from the very first day as there will fall quite a lot of fingerprints on the phone back6. Liked the rear camera placement and looks of the phone.

I  Brought this phone  on 27.02.2022 , since 3days I'm facing Auto display OFF and erratic  multiple display showing and mobile unable to get restart. first time( On 03.05.2022)  it took  approx. 5 mins to get normal or restart, second time ( On 04.05.2022 )  approx. 5 mins to get restart.  Third time ( on 07.05.2022 ) it took approx. 20 -25 mins to get restart .  Complain lodge with  ONE PLUSE Online service for assistance .  I think ONE PLUS MANAGEMENT should  immediate think about the  ONE PLUSE NORD CE 2 mobile phone technical glitch on high priority . Other wise ONE plus may loose customers faith in market .  Looking forward for a better support from ONE PLUS team  in this regard .

Am posting this review after 7 days usage. I was very skeptical to buy OnePlus phone, and was using Redmi phones since 7 yrs. But this time was upset on Redmi OS and bought OnePlus. Am very happy with this phone. No hang,no battery heat. Moderate usage will have two days battery life. Good camera. Very easy to carry with lighter weight. Go for it guys.

It's my first experience with one plus and has been good till now.  I am not a gamer. But for multimedia and casual photos the experience has been good. In hand field is good and software experience is nice without any bloatware. The Bahamas blue colour is exotic. Well optimised Ram management. Single speaker but is of good quality. Earpiece is loud and clear. Signal quality is good. Carrier aggregation is working fine. Haptic motor is good. Charger is simply amazing. 30 mins full charge. You can go for it provided you are not a hardcore gamer.

I am writing this after one complete month of usgae of phone.The phone is a good midranger one if you get it under 20 K using the exchange offer and card one too but not worth it if you get it for 24 K .If you are going to invest 24 K then go for Realme GT Master Edition Or Redmi Note 11 Pro 5g Or Realme 9 Pro 5g Or Iqoo Phones or Samsung M series phones.The Pros AreThe Processor is very good in this range and have multibands 5g.It has a 90 HZ Amoled (Good) Display.The OS is very nice.The Battery 🔋 stays long and is accomplished by 65 watt charger which makes it much more valuable.It can have memory card as well have two sims which is amazing.ConsThe Camera 📸 is not up to the mark as one hopes one plus will give.It lacks the the one plus slider.Overall it's a good choice for 20 K.

This review is after 3 weeks of use of Oneplus nord ce2 5g (8gb 128gb)1. Pros- Display is good and gets quite bright in outdoors due to its claimed 800 nits brightness.- Supports upto 8 5G bands. Has wifi 6, bluetooth 5.2, nfc, dual 4G sims with expandable storage.- Mediatek dimensity 900 by no means is an efficienct chip and is a power hogger. But it packs a punch for day to day use. No lag and stutters. Snapdragon SOC fans might want to avoid this phone- Calls are clear and loud. Stereo speaker is single and is decent.- Screen refresh rate of 90hz is sufficient and the general use at 90hz feels smooth and fluid.- Under display fingerpriny reader is accurate and never misreads.2. Cons- Camera is decent and requires daylight to take crisp and crystal clear photos.- Battery life is 1 day for heavy users and is 2 days for light users. I got 8hrs of SOT with medium to heavy use. Mind that it was always on 90hz mode.Overall package is good and i'm totally satisfied with it.

Review after 10 days.It's a very good and practical phone if you are able to purchase it under 20k by applying coupons and exchange.Build : I like metal build but Ok with the plastic and Glass builds as well. This is very light and compact phone made by plastic back and frame.Display : 90 Hz is a sweet spot. Feels smooth and good on battery as well.Performance : Processor is doing more than good for day to day tasks. I don't play games so I can't comment on it.Battery : 4500MAH is decent power. It can last a day. 65W charger is amazing charges battery in 35 mins.Os : It's still clean Oxygen os on top of Color os. They should have given Android 12 out of the box.Camera : Missing OIS but not so many phone come in this price range with it. It clicks decent photos and videos in good lighting but struggles a lot in poor light conditions.Cons : I feel they should have provided stereo speakers, iconic alert slider, OIS in main camera and Android 12 out of box.

This is one of the best phone in mid range. But don't expect lot, it just doing good performance. I am a regular usage, just few applications so 2 days battery life I am getting. Camera is okay, try different methods to get clear photo. I use sometimes AI off/no, so we can get different clarity. Display is awesome, it support HRD10+. Not sure in Netflix. Slider button is missing, however I was never use the slider button in my OnePlus 3 earlier. I got this phone at 16500 with exchange of my OnePlus 3 and some Amazon coupon. So it's worth to buy with offers.

A big fan of 1+ phones n this is my fourth 1+ during last 6-7 years. Reason : Price competitive for the same specs of other Chinese competition makes. That brings the brand No. 2 in sales. But, definitely the brand's overall quality including battery is getting deteriorated since it has been started assembling in Vivo Noida plant.Now abt this product : Plastic type body doesn't give that bad impression, as often critics say. Other established brands in this range n specs r also have plastic body to make product lighter, though it adds to poor heat dissipation problem. U can't feel that unless u have ""never satisfied"" typo critic eyes.Call quality n internet performance is superb matching to processor specs. Can handle group video calls well in even weaker net. Picture quality is awesome with good color n in-depth reproduction. Heavier games make it hotter, but again that's the problem with every phone. Better remove phone cover while playing games.

I purchased one plus nord ce 2 5G on 29th April from Amazon and phone was delivered on 1st May. Phone screen freezed on 20th May and I dropped the phone at your authorised service centre in jammu.As per service centre people the phone sreen is not working. How can it be that within 20 days of purchase the phone screen turns to be faulty and the service centre that they does not have spare parts to repair it . What warranty the company is offering if spare aren’t available. This was my first purcahse and i I think this will also turn out to be last with this kind of product and service. No response from customer care. Now they have given me 27 June date for receiving parts then it will be repaired

One of the worst service, they gave the warranty for one year but it is not applicable for any damage it is worst worst warranty provided by the one plus brand. After 25days of very normal usage  display is gone ,my Mobile having not even single scratch outside but display gone how it is possible I don't know. Sooo I went to the service center they confirmed display is damaged @6500rs warranty is not applicable for display damage  they said . I don't know what should I do not even one month of usage and not even my mistake,why I need to pay money.soooo friends I want want share my bad bad bad experience with one plus who want to buy one plus plz plz  don't buy and don't feel like me

1. Camera quality is just average like 15-19K mobile phone. Doesn't seems like this is oneplus mobile phone camera. I have upgraded from Redmi Note 10 and felt very little improvement in camera.2. Performance is also just okay. I have used oneplus nord 2 which is just 4K expensive than Nord CE 2 but way more faster than this.3. Battery life is great. Charging time is same as mentioned.Overall it is just an okay phone. Nothing special. 4-5K expensive than what is actually offered hence it is overpriced or doesn't justify it's price.

Its not been many days I bought the phone , I faced the issue with audio jack. I thought of enjoying the audio personally by attaching the earphones, but no sound i can hear. Initially I thought earphones were the problem and i try to change them. But there is no use. I try to restart the phone with the earphones plugged in, this time there is some improvement that the audio jack started working, but as soon as I unplugged the earphones, the speaker is not working. Also microphones are also not working.Adding to above, I started using the phone nowdays as a hot pack to relieve my pains. A good relief for me. thanks to One plus for the multipurpose. It is mentioned that average time to charge the phone is just 15 minutes with 65W charges, but my phone is taking almost an hour to get fully charged.

Camera is okayish, although the night mode and slow mo is quite cool, battery life is very long after long screen hour, lasts almost 24 hours (for me), in hand feeling is quite good, only the ringer button is absent and i literally could not figure yet how to make my phone in silent, it only switches between ring and vibrate. Otherwise till now good experience. Lookwise also it's really classy,.

I have no point of comparison except for my older oppo A83(2018) model. Thats an older model and yet very much better than the new ONE PLUS.  I should have gone for an Oppo newer model as replacement but wanted to try this.15 days after my purchase,  the phone fell down from a high table, maybe about 4-4.5 feet high and the screen broke.Now I have to shell another 8k to get it replaced. While at store, I met three other people who had come for screen replacement too as theirs also broke.  One guy was coming to get it replaced 2nd time.If you do however plan to purchase the phone,  go for a wallet style cover, because I dont think this phone can take any other type of case.My phone was in an open case provided by ONE PLUS and screen was covered with gorilla glass.My oppo falls down on an average 2-3 times a day,  and have had no issues in the past 3 years.... Except for the fact that the memory has become too less for me to accomodate all the apps,  I would have stuck to my oppo.Overall for a brand like ONE PLUS,  I expected better.😞 DISAPPOINTED!!!PROS : The fast charger is really awesome.  30 mins charges it to full. Thats the only feature I love about it.

Very poor OnePlus series mobile phone( Nord CE 2). It is very ordinary handset which can be bought in the range of 15K INR .OnePlus is selling in the name of Amoled display, I am Frankly speaking display is ever poor. It's display is disappointed me too much. Other Nords series phone had good display pic quality. I was in this impression and bought it  I have wasted hard earn money in such low grade handset. I am also surprised that how the ratings of this mobile is more than 4.5 .I recommend you all don't buy this phone, OnePlus is not that one by which we were knowing, now they are cheating us. You can find very good handset in realme brand in this price range.

Worst phone. There is problem in my display ( Green line occured in my phone display ). Display is blurring when I used the phone phone just 2 to 3 days of delivery. Then i contacted to OnePlus customer care and they are saying the software updating issue. Then on 30/05/2022 the green line occured in display. I think my 24999 money is wasted. Service centre par display bhi available nhi hai. Still no updates from OnePlus service centre. I opted the pick and drop facility on 18/06/2022. Only phone received message is shown in oneplus care app that the phone is received on 24/06/2022 at Delhi exclusive service centre.

First of all,i wanted to buy a oneplus.In below 30000 I thought I can go through this model.Some reviews are like its not worth buying it,still i chose it.And am nit wrong 😃Am in love with this phoneThe backcase they gave with this phone is even more loving.It takes only 30 minutes to full charge.For me,i use my ph more,i even play bgmi,still charging once a day is enough.I was actually feared that if its ok or not to order a ph online.But thats fine,igot it on the mentioned date.the camera is also fine,it depends on our adjustments.am a selfie person.with little 😍 beauty adjustments photos are perfect.Gaming is also superb in this ph.

My OnePlus Nord 2 5G/ Nord CE 2 5G connected to broadband wifi.Now if I recieve call or make a call,- I can't hear other person voice clearly (it's breaking),- and other person also can't hear my voice clearly.If I turn off the wifi during the call, everything works fine.It's really ridiculous that these costly phones doesn't work for such a basic required functionality.I've tried two brand new OnePlus Nord 2 5G and 1 Nord CE 2 5G, everywhere it's same.(I've posted the same question on OnePlus forum, waiting for some solution, but I can see there are many people facing the same problem without any solution)

I have used it for more than a day and based on that, I am writing this review. The phone looks premium. I bought two of them and both the colours (Grey and Blue) are beautiful. It's a lightweight phone that gives a nice feel in hands. Comes with a transparent back cover that fits quite well. Camera quality is good but it should be improved with upcoming updates. I haven't checked 20x zoom yet. User interface is interesting but users like me need some time to become familiar with it. Charger definitely is faster than the supercars. It charges from 10 to 100 percent in 25-30 mins only without heating up. But the problem is the battery life. Without any high uses, it drained so fast. OnePlus must resolve this issue with upcoming updates. I am a moderate gamer and the phone doesn't hang at all, nor I experienced any heating issue. Touch is really smooth and the screen/display colours etc looks really wonderful (I am not a professional so can't write using professional jargons). Fingerprint sensor is fast enough and the animation associated with it looks beautiful. Overall it seems a nice phone to buy.May update the review after using it for a longer period.

phone is very good, delivery is very good, features are very good, charging also very good ,video quality is very good when compared to other phones. it is amazing. except sound quality. and i noticed  it is not satisfactory & vibrating for sounds on  backside . i d'not know whether it is my piece fault or it is phone original structure. i put for replacement , then they send technician .he re commended for replacement if i am not satisfied.but they did not clarify for the replacement and put  file a claim for refund.but any way i don't want to take refund even if they do not replace the item as i liked the phone  performance except sound.

won't say it's pricey, definitely not that cheap either. this phone is very dear to me, for my day to day usage it fits into me like a ribbon and a gift. sweet performance and the battery and charging is legit the way i wanted. damn, a packed monster with ultra fast charging as a cherry on top definitely wins the tag that it holds. although android 12 didn't roll on this device yet but so for, this one just performs oneplus!!!definitely won't feel oppo if you guys are thinking it as otherwise but kind of does just a slight percent, definitely not more than 1, not gonna lie but in the end it is oneplus. truly. one fine produced phone in the market and glad that i chose this over the nord 2, had my heart over there too albeit wouldn't know about it.love this phone!!! everything is great, so far!

Product service at Oneplus store is not good. After just 20 days since I bought I had an issue in speaker during calling (voice interrupt in upper speaker) when i reached the service center it worked there, so they didn't accept my service request on that day, again i faced the same issue so next day again i went to service center and spoke to service engineer there reg. issue so he checked phone, even he didn't knew how the issue is occurring, so finally they  they considered my service req. and deposited my phone now its more than 2 days, imagine u paid Rs.25K and have to keeping roaming to service center that to just within 20 days!so finally they said, they will check and let me know, but i asked them to provide replacement and now its more than 2 days since  i submitted my phone and they didn't responded yet.

I ordered this phone reading reviews online, but all is part of OnePlus marketing hype,1- camera quality is same as poco or most mi phone in 20k price segment2- battery charging superfast but draining the way a 200cc bike sucks the fuel.battery is the main issue ,

The phones look is outstanding but remember we don’t invest 25k just for that…the screen went off with in 40 days  of usage and when I sent it to the service centre (located somewhere in Bengaluru through the repair request placed on oneplus care app)..I received a call after  7 days saying that the screen has an internal damage..amazingly none of us can see any damage from outside still they kept on buzzing that the screen is damaged internally coz of some external pressure and hence no warranty cover and gave me an estimation of Rs.6872 for repair of screen…imagine..all this just after a 40day usage of phone…customer care and service centre guys are humble in explaining everything but I  really really hate this brand from now on….DONT FALL FOR THE CLAIMS Like SLIMMEST MODEL BLAH BLAH…WASTE OF MONEY PURE WASTE..be wise and choose a reliable brand or phone

Camera quality of phone is very good.It's light weight, nicely designed.Back cover, is provided with the phone.THE ONLY THING ANNOYING ME IS THE PHONE IS GETTING HEATED WHILE TAKING FOR MORE THE 7-8 MINUTES. FOR ME THATS THE AREA OF CONCERN.CAN #AMAZONE @ONEPLUS TEAM HELP ME OUT IF THIS???

OnePlus kinda pulled this one out by a miracle.So the reason for this statement is because it feels too good to be true on the surface and if you are someone like me then there's a high chance you have watched every review of this phone already so lets see what we find :The build is like a Flagship, no issues and really well built feel in-hand. retains the audio jack on the sacrifice of the mute switch on the side but personally not a very big thing in usage at all. single speaker but loud like real loud. Type C with fast charging that charges the phone upto 70 in the first 20 mins then another 10-15 mins to reach 100 (that's like real fast for a charger guys). OS is the best side of this, default oxygen os with enough customization and do note that i was a Nova Launcher user so having an stock launcher that too on my daily driver means this thing rocks! . Performance is really good, easily beats any competition out there, no heating issues or battery drain issues or lag, had the best BGMI experience yet (Smooth+Extreme with constant 60FPS) thats really good and also good enough for any game you plan to play on the device. Cameras are a mix of the camera you would expect with a little more and for the price range they are great :)overall if you ask me (i got this phone for 17k) its a really great phone and you should just go with it, the best phone in the budget segment Period.

Was having high expectations while buying. I own a Samsung S20 FE 5G and this OnePlus Nord CE2 was bought as a gift for mom. I should say that I was disappointed. There is a slight lag issue(many already reported, which I ignored while buying).Another thing I noticed is that, the call recording feature is hectic. Like the new phones, it starts the recording after the voice warning. But my S20 FE doesn't warn like this.Another thing is, the auto call recording can be enabled for all non-saved numbers, but for contacts saved in your phone, you would have to manually add them one by one to the list so that auto-recording would happen. That's the most stupid thing. Because most of us would have 1000s of contacts. And adding them one by one to the list for auto-call recording is a tedious task.Another issue is, the camera is way too below average. Expected a better camera from this phone.And I initially noticed some heating issue on the screen side.One advantage is that, the weight is less. So carrying it or using it with your hands won't be a headache.

I have recently bought this phone 2 days back and I have exchanged my redmi note 7s for this which I was using for past 3 years,the exchange process was smooth and the delivery agent was helpful and very patient.Coming to the model,I m first time OnePlus user but people in my family were using OnePlus earlier, the camera quality and refresh rate is good I'm only disappointed by battery backup the phone charges in 15mins but at night when I sleep I switch off internet connection and the phone is on battery saver mode still phone lost 10% battery this is very disappointing that when I'm not even using it and the phone is new then why this is happening.

I have used the phone more than 4 months. Battery backup is not up to the mark. Intially the battery gets charged very quickly but now it takes time to get charged. Camera quality is average and in low light it is worst. Not expected from one plus.  Touch is also average. Display is also average. One thing I would say this phone looks very beautiful and better than Samsung phones of this budget. Overall it's an average phone.

Battery 🔋 life in average but takes very less time to recharge so it is okay. Camera is better than other phones of this range. Display is smooth and processor is as expected by one plus. I have previously used one plus 3T for 4 years. Definitely the quality of one plus phones is still up to mark. The only thing I didn't like is mirror back of phone as now a days better looking phones are available.

Pros: 1) Premium Looks2) SuperVOOC Fast Charging is really Fast. Charges within half an hour. Great Battery Backup.3) Great Cam4) Awesome Display5) On Screen Fingerprint Sensor is fast.6) Seamless UICons: 1) Gaming is good but I believe could have better at this price point owing to Dimensity Processor upgrade.2) Camera is good but not as per One Plus Standards.Miscellaneous:1) Free Silicon Back Cover2) Red Cable Membership with 3 months extended warranty and 3 months Spotify Premium.

I wanted to gift a fone to my parents, after a research of almost 20 days I ended up taking 2 mobiles of this Nord 2 5g...1) User friendly interface, specially for elder ones.2) Battery is long lasting3) Fingerprint senser is fast enough.4) The camera is satisfactory.5) Sound quality is wonderful.Overall the fone is worth the money.

Bought this phone at 22K inr. So consider this price for my review.Camera is hit and miss. Sometime it takes amazing shot, sometimes it just fumbles.EIS with 1080p60 is amazing. You will capture more videos than expected.UI: Coming from MIUI. Its very easy for me to say Oxygen OS is amazing. No debate in thatBattery: Amazing, will change how you use your phone. 15 minute is enough for 4 hours of use. It gives so peace of mind, once you tried it you wont be able to live without it.FP sensor is okay not as snappy as side or rear one but still work fine. You wont notice it.Feel: Super Slippery buy a rugged case immediately. Amazing to look at like. But feels delicate.Price: for 22K its a steal. For original price add little more to get Nord 2T, Poco F4, Nothing phone(1) all these phone are affordable flagship.This phone is just a mid-range phone and should cost 22K for 25 you are better off with spending little more and get those above mentioned phones.

Camera quality.I bought OnePlus Nord ce 2 5g 2 days back and found that cam is worst than a mobile under 10k. I raised an support request and meanwhile have done factory reset to handover to Amazon. I'm not sure how but factory reset has resolved the cam issue but the technician didn't visit Instead he called me and guided me to install a software and said the product is good and closed the request. Not satisfied with the support and what if my cam shows up same issue. I feel replacement/refund should be done, as this will not be possible after 2/3 days for my order.

As mentioned in other reviews this phone indeed has decent camera quality compared to other phones in this budget band. But I found other features that are unique to this phone mentioned below.1.  NFC ( I know small feature but no other phone includes this one under 25K)2.  65W Charging3.  Wi-Fi 64.  Wi-Fi Tethering5.  LDAC Codec supportedand trust me Bahamas Blue color is awesome!!!

It's a decent phone in its class but you get better options in same price in the market . The wide angel camera is not that good. No zoom option in 64 mp camera mode. Didn't like the slow-motion video . Macro shot is not great to work with . Battery drains quite quickly in normal usage in a day. Speaker sound is not that good. Display lacks vivid colours as the Samsung display is way better in 15k budget phones if you ask me .Pros.1: 3.5mm jack port that was missing previously2: currently the cheapest OnePlus. so , it's affordable.3: decent camera in the class but not the best.

I have been using one plus since one plus 1, and last one phone I was using was one plus 6t, I purchased this phone as it was cheap and one plus was giving almost everything thing in it, but to my surprise, it is nothing like one plus. There is lot of connectivity issue in this ph, wifi doesn't works, u cannot talk on ph as u  cannot here the other person, Bluetooth not working, camera is below average, battery draining very fast.. very much disappointed. Will not recommend this phone.

For those who have used phones with 6000mAh batteries, the One Plus with a 4500mAh battery would look a bit much insufficient.Colour (Bahamas Blue) with a glass back is something that makes the phone eye catching.It’s light weight is another feature that makes the phone handling quite easy.Word or Excel cannot be opened directly from WhatsApp , I guess a package needs to be installed.The glass surface makes sliding and gliding thru the pages a very comfortable experience.Overall a few additional features and a min 5000 mAh battery would have made this phone worth the buy.

The Phone is definatly good, but price is a bit high. no doubt its oneplus, and oneplus give a robust hardware which can run upto 3-4 years without any problem.My Criteria -5G - no need till 2023, let 5G network launch first.Charging/battery - 65w charger, best in segment.Proccessor - Mediatek, better if it was Snapdragon. (I compromise)Screen - Amoled.Camera - Not good (feels like I got scam)Features -Camera - camera is not good, it produce whitish pictures, Oneplus please update the software.Battery - Good, with fast chargingDesign - Its very handy phone with standard size.Processor - Its mediatek , better if it was snapdragonOverall - Camera is not good, may be in next software update camera will be fine.you can find better options in market. refer to the criteria above and make your decision.

I bought it for my father, who is an average user with only using phone for calling, reading news, watching youtube, messaging..Just common stuff.Not gaming.So I opted this over Samsung(Which was the priority;A52s) because this has an headphone jack, good speaker,90 hz oled screen, clean and smooth software and good processor.(Same features in A52s but 6000 cheaper).And he didn't even have a complaint till now.So I am summarizingPros:Excellent Screen-90 Hz oledGood & Clean software-Oxygen OS 11Loud speaker- Eventhough monoSuper Fast charging-65 WAbove average battery performanceGood processing-Dimensity 900Better Haptics than SamsungCons:Below average camera-Eventhough the outcome is very sharp and detailed, the colouring and skin tone is very bad.Need big improvements through software update.If your first priority is camera look for samsung,10x better photos and dynamic rangeSo consider all this I have mentioned before buying.

I have ordered this item after doing lot of research for a good phone within my 25k budget. I am not so camera enthusiastic, gaming and chatting person and needed some good phone within my budget meeting my basic expecations like good battery backup, latest Android OS, touch, UI, screen size, weight, call recording options etc..And I have heard lot of good impressions on the OnePlus phones from past.But I am very disappointed by ordering this item as it had some heating issues. The phone heats so fast while charging and using it for continoisly 15-20 mins. I had to return this item after calling customer care and inspecting the phone by installing mInspect app as they found some problem with charging. If you are fine with heating issues then go ahead buying this product .As I am not so camera enthusiastic person I could not judge much on the camera front. But could take some decent pictures with good image clarity. Also could not check much on the battery as it had heating issues.But touch sensitivity is all good and a good phone which meets your basic expectation within 25k.One plus could have given more focus on resolving the heating issues for this type of flagship phone. And its light weight phone (173 gm) which is easy to carry and handle. Screen size (6.43 inches) is also standard which is enough for viewing videos and chatting. Overall if you are fine with heating issues then its a good option within 25k budget.

This is for the people who want to go with a stable brand.If you want to buy iPhone 11 but due to budget constraints you are not able to buy then this is the phone which is handy to use does all the necessary work, and captures great images. The looks are awesome but the plastic back panel disappointing it could be glass. The good thing is you get one plus stickers and a plastic back cover with damage protection (the design of the back cover in a way that it protects your mobile glass from the damage the corners are edgy) so you don't need to buy it with extra cost. Just go for it I bought it for 23999. Very smooth and slick handset. It's not grey...complete mirror but with a black tone. silver you can consider. light weight.

I experienced a problem in searching for a phone, no if you stored a no with +91 then this will not search with +91, not working well in comparison to Samsung, this phone is using basic Google android software.Also while using the call recording feature it always gives a warning to another person ""this call is being recorded"" so waste.Otherwise, this phone is working well...

Do not exchange your mobile.I have purchased Nord CE with in exchange of Nokia 6.1 plus for Rs 3250/-.At the time of delivery, delivery boy rejected saying there is scratches on side panel & it has dents.After use of 3.6 year how can there will be no scratches or dents.There was no diagnosis done at the time of exchange.

Single speaker4. Battery life is hardly half day for normal usage. But good thing is super fast charging.5. Many basic default options are missing when Compared to Samsung like photo editing, collage, editing the values in calculator.

Blindly buy this product and enjoy the smooth and stylish Phone.

Battery life is good, easily lasts a day for my usage, with frequent chat updates, some music playing, once or twice camera usage etc.Display quality, photo quality, sound quality are all above average.However, a bug that disappointed me is that the fingerprint sensor doesn't turn on even in always on display mode. And the bug is so bad, that almost always, the power button has to be pressed for unlocking the phone and at times even then, the fingerprint sensor doesn't give prompt and so the pin has to be entered. Pathetic, I'd say.Worse still is, as understood from the OnePlus community website, the bug is known to the developers, but they've been unable to bring an resolution to this issue till now.

In comparison to many other phones in the same segment, this model does not come upto the mark. Starting on a full charge in the morning the battery drained very fast without any usage and by evening it was 50%. In Oppo, for instance, which was my earlier phone (unfortunately it was stolen), I could watch 2 to 3 films one after another and still the battery would last me the whole day for other heavy usage things. Apart from this the 1+ battery charges very slow. The screen size is smaller, there is half a centimetre gap at the bottom where the screen does not come down right to the edge of the phone. That screen gap irritates as does the time display where the first number is in red. Another irritant as the eyes misread it most of the time! Sound quality is shrill and not nice. Colour display is dull Camera and the pictures taken are ok.

So it's been about a week that I am using this phone and I don't regret buying it. Its 90 Hz refresh rate is so smooth. Got two security patch updates too in a week which is really a great thing.The camera is really good. The phone looks premium and is lightweight and slim. It feels good in hand.Even though the speaker is mono firing speaker and not stereo speakers, it really is very loud. The screen is beautiful and there's Gorilla Glass 5 protection on the front and back.Now, coming to the battery, it easily lasts a whole day and it charges real quick and you're ready to use it whole day (100% battery)after just 35-40 mins of charge.I do casual gaming (BGMI and COD) and I didn't find any lag or jitter. So no complain about that.So overall satisfied with this phone so far.

As it is said to be trusted brand.I don't feel it really.Small small features are missing. Speed dial is not there which is available in nokia 1100 phone also. This is one example.I was POCO F1 user for 3 years. Not single time it got hanged. But this phone hanged 3 times in last 10 days. Black colour display come for 1 minute.Camera of POCO is 12 MP and this is 64 MP. STILL poco is best in zooming quality. Only point that camera captures colour in superb way than poco.Finger sensor is slower , unlock is slowerOnly point for me is good in this phone is fast charging which I don't know how many month of years remain same.And 2nd is dedicated slot for memoryThanks but don't go for this phone.

Everything is fine in this phone but the build quality looks much cheaper and camera quality is worst then 10K phones and genuinely my older phone Realme 5 Pro gives much better picture quality then this phone. Previously I have used OnePlus X too and my experience was very good with that phone that's why I bought OnePlus phone again.

Model:One plus Nord CE 2 (grey) 6 GB , 128GBPrice:18000 after exchangeNot so smooth in operation. There is time lag unlike other flagship phones of same range. Moreover, the fingerprint reader is also lagging. Camera quality is good in daylight.Sometime, the phone get stuck for around 10 seconds.Best design and build quality.

Pretty much everything is good, as an android phone most things remain same, refresh rate and charging speed are the top pros that I found and talking about top cons, they will surely be nothing but I think there could have been better camera quality in this budget segment.

I have used this mobile of 8gb ram for a month. For 1+ fans, this mobile is awesome at below 25000 price, this mobile looks stylish, performance is too fast, graphics is awesome for high end games. As this mobile is a 5g mobile and if your budget is Rs20000-25000, you should buy this mobile. In box it does contain a fast charger.

1. Phone Call problem  While making a phone call sometimes the other speakers does not hear my voice and sometimes I can't hear the other speaker. I bought on 13th May it's not even worth 5k phone.2. Touch screen isn't working well too3. Amazon has no replacement  policyPlease do not make the same mistake like I you can go for other brand. I bought this phone after reading the reviews and I got scammed. This phone doesn't deserve one star .

Having connectivity problem. Call snaps after sometime or the other side can't hear. I have changed SIM and Provider but the same problem happens. OnePlus is not doing anything.Amazon please replace the phone as i bought on the faith of your brand.

Good phone. But camera is average like 16000/- phone. Thay given mono speaker, in this price range we can get Dolby on other phone. Any way performance is good. Very fast like blink of your eyes. But much over priced. It should come in 22k to 23k range.

Review on 1st dayThe phone is superb amazing with camera,sound,the famous ""Oxygen Os"" the first day didn't disappoint me although i will write agai after 15 days of usage but till now it's amazing .After 15days- The phone is amazing from top to bottom just that you don't compare cameras to another high price phone i felt the night shits were not that clear but it was bright and day time photos are very fine overall after 15days of continuous usage the phone is solid . Great 1+

I have been using this phone for the past 3 to 4 days so I noticed a few pros and cons:Pros :1. light weight and the slimmest one2. Fast charging3. Offcourse very good display for Netflix and Amazon.4. Good performance not even a slightest lag I faced.5. Oxygen OS so no bloatware and ads.Cons:1. Camera is not that good and not that bad...average.2. Phone gets warmer while playing games and also while charging specifically between 20 to 80%.That is also I could notice.

Recommended for casual use. Quick battery charge, battery life's for a day considering high usage of 8-9hrs. As it is oxygen OS no bloatware issues. Screen touch works good, no delay seen.Disappointment is,- Android 11 ver.- Slight scratches on backcase. Ignorable, though matters.- Uniqueness mark of the brand is missing.Cons,- Camera quality not upto the mark.- Low sound.- Battery heats up very quickly while using high utilisation apps.- Can't use hotspot for morethan 2hrs, again battery issue.- Not recommended for gamers.

Worst product as per the brand oneplus. Battery life is very poor (drains very fast), sound quality not good and even camera quality is very poor. Overall, my suggestion is not to buy this model. You can get very good quality mobiles in this price in other mobile brands. It's waste of money in buying this mobile. Even mobile prizes are very high on amazon as compare to tata neu. It's almost rs 3000 high on Amazon

I'm writing this review after using the phone for 2 months. Its front camera is not as expected. It's sound system is also very low. Also it have a lot heating issues. It hangs sometimes and also some time it slow down charging. Also it didn't include some basic features. So in my opinion if you want to waste your 25000 then please buy it.

Writing this review after using one and half month.Camera quality is not good, apps are getting crashed, Contact widgets are getting deleted after restart. Figer print option is disappearing sometimes. Battery is also not upto the mark.Over all I lost impression on one plus and regretting my purchase. Other than fast charging I didn't see anything good in this phone. At this price range there are other mobiles providing better cam quality with better performance.Expected something better from one plus, completely disappointed 😞

Ordered this mobile with great enthusiasm and it dint let me down the expectations. Overall mobile is good. performance is awesome. Value to money. Only concern is they told it will charge completely in 15mins but it's not the case it takes a bit more than that. Other than that no other concerns about this product.

Best budget mobile from OnePlus. Screen brightness and refresh rate is best. It's super amoled screen is really great and changes viewing experience to watch full hd videos. Performance is also good. Both front and rear Cameras are best. Charging is ultra fast with 65 watt charger. It's glass finish back is really eye catching and makes it look premium mobile. But sometimes it hangs for seconds. May solve after update to Android 12.

Phone is no doubt smooth but after a month usage i think the camera is really absurd, night pictures are worst, my friend is using note 10 pro and its camera is really well but don't go with that bcs you will not like its UI...

My phone attracts people bcs it shines a lot so i need to laminate it with blur transparent covering..  battery is good and audio quality is amazing

This is an amazing phone for people looking at OnePlus brand to start with. I have previously owned One plus 2 and a One plus 5T and when I had to switch this time, I didn’t want to move away from OnePlus brand and spend too much money as well. I am a basic smartphone user and use this for basic browsing, social media, YouTube etc and this phone meets the performance bar. If you are looking for a good phone without making compromises on quality of components, camera etc, you can definitely consider this.

Great product from OnePlus it is not meant for the heavy user but works excellent in performing day to day task . Camera quality is also good n the design of phone is also sleek and if u get fed up using samsung phone n want to switch to other brand I think one plus is far good option to go with only the thing I don't lyk is it comes wid Android 11 but at this price range many companies are giving 12 but we can ignore this thing too n comparing this wid moto edge 30 still I can say OnePlus works better.

The phone is very flimsy and the camera quality is the poorest I've seen on a One plus phone (this was our 3rd one plus)And be careful about Amazon's no return policy. They would've mentioned a 7 day replacement only. So now we're stuck with the phone. We should better go back to old days where we buy phones from show rooms. Amazon is doing this on many electronics recently.

It's been two weeks since I bought this phone and suddenly when i was using it, it turned off by itself and it won't charge or reboot. If there is no One plus service centre  near you, i suggest you not to buy it as it even with a warranty I can't do anything because the customer care told me that i have to put in all the charges for the delivery of my phone to another one plus service centre which is in another state. Once i get this phone repaired with my own money even though i have a warranty i'll sell it and never buy a one plus ever again.

The performance of the phone is very good. It's been two weeks now and haven't seen any issues. Cameras are really good and nice pictures. Battery capacity could have been better with more mah (say 5000 mah and above), but the fast charging is just amazing. About 20 minutes, the battery is completely charged.

I am using this phone for over 3 moths now  and it is working perfectly. Camera quality is fine specially night photography. Only thing I wish if they could give a 6k mah battery, right now it is a 4500 mah. The 65W charger is an advantage as it charges from 15 to 100% in 35-40 mins. So if you are in hurry a 15-20 mins charge will do.

The camera is just sooo bad , i have photos from 2011 clicked on my nokia 2700 classic which still look better than this new phone. Do not buy it at all guys. Save your money and go for something else. This phone sucks. Whooever has designed this camera was high af. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.

I purchased the first unit and this arrived early.The phone is definitely worth all the hype and price.Also got a free membership to Red Cable Club and some other perks.Pros:Fast and easy to useFast charging, charges within 15mins.Good phone coverCons:Camera is good, but not as expectedGets heated up while using specific appsSince it is blue, the fingerprints will remain at the back of the phone.

we could not judge a phone on 5 to 6 days used, as initially  i feel that the 1 plus nord CE2 having good features & its really feel smooth during handling , & having feel brand value too..but i expected that after 1 yr or onward the phone should have same consistency too... at that time we can say that brand value are trustworthy...because we have also pay same for that comparing to other branded phone.. but now overall is amazing lets see onward...

 Back option is not available/responding while talking. I didn't excepted this kind of problems after a month of operation. Poor quality from OnePlus. I need replacement or cashback for this. Also attached video edvince for the same. Worst product ever I have used. I need to know who's mistake here either amazon has provided defective product or the issue from OnePlus. Kindly take this note to supplier and provide justification.

Software glitch is a big issue. Sometimes something works, sometimes it doesn't. Moreover, they are still using the Android 11. They must give the latest version since they are taking 25K.Yes, the battery and charger is quite good. It charges to full in almost 45 minutes and if you charge for 10 minutes, you can run it for 2-3 hours. But one problem - device shuts down without any prior warning when battery is down.

Phone gets heated within no time , I bought this phone 20 days ago and it gets heated in such a way that there would no use with the iron box at home , performance wise I would give it a good feedback but gets heated after using 1-2 hours and charging gets drained with in no time my old phone which is much cheaper than this and much older did not ever make me or feel bad for buying that but really disappointed by the performance of this mobile

Please don't go for this phone as per one plus service centre this phone could bend if you put it In your tight jeans pocket and display could break. Even if you don't have a single scratch on your phone doesn't mean your phone will get repaired incase you face any issue within warranty period. OnePlus has too many reasons to make your mobile OutOfWarranty coverage.Still if you wanna try your luck please go for it and feel the same.

Waste of money, literally regretting after buying this phone. Please do not waste money by buying this phone.It hangs frequently, u have to restart the phone every time. It is so frustrating.

I bought the 8/128 Bahama Blue variant and so far impressed with the phone. The Dimensity 900 SoC is doing a fairly good job and the 8 5g bands makes it future-proof. Display and Camera are great. The 65W charging is quite fast however the phone does heat up a little during charging. The plastic back is a downside but you can use the backcover provided with the box. All in all, an excellent mid-range phone with the brand value of 1+.

This is entry level smartphone from OnePlus. Don't expect magic out of the box. This phone is for those who don't expect much from an entry-level phone.The camera app in this device is very good. The AI function in camera is working fine. Colors don't look natural in HDR mode. The tripod mode is useless without a tripod. Video stabilization is very good.

I have using one plus Nord CE 2 on past two weeks it's having good features and user friendly to operate the mobile OS. Performance and camera quality quite good for this price range phone. Battery charging is very good with in 30 minutes battery fully charged and sensing of finger print and face detection is also good. This price range this spec phone is great.

While making call the entire screen/background is going white and was not able to do anything like accessing functions such as turning on speaker phone or even disconnecting.

Right of the box, the look and feel of the phone is amazing. Added to that is the 90hz display that feels crisp and smooth. Camera is a little off the mark when it comes to One Plus standards. It could have better.Overall a good option, when your tight on budget, but want a premium range phone.

As OnePlus gives you very good user experience, this version of Nord abides by the same.

Not happy with battery life also OS is not handy, no options to share contact number as SMS & by default it goes on MMS, if you put call recording on phone announces it loudly at call start which embraces a lot, call recording must be told by phone owner  at starting of call not by phone company or OS

Though it's a mid range phone for 5g it never gives you a normal one plus phone impression, camera is worst , display is average. You will see a lag whenever you use Instagram and often I see a issue even after the muting, the audio is popping out
"

a decent phone, with everything just average nor too good nor too bad, the screen, camera, battery, mono speaker, the only thing that is impressive is the charging speed of super vooc. Would not recommend for this price until you are looking for oneplus only.
